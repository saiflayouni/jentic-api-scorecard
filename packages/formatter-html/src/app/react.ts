// Public React entry (`@jentic/api-scorecard-formatter-html/react`).
// Consumers render <Scorecard data={result} /> with their own React; the components
// are styled with stock Tailwind utility classes, so a Tailwind pipeline must be
// present (a `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>` tag is enough).
// The internal building blocks (SummaryCard, DimensionCard, …) stay unexported until
// there's a concrete consumer — adding them later is non-breaking; removing is not.
