An OpenAPI document that passes validation isn't necessarily one an AI agent can use. Grammar is
one thing; semantic clarity, safety, and discoverability are another. The **Jentic API Scorecard**
scores your OpenAPI document against the
[Jentic API AI Readiness Framework (JAIRF)](https://github.com/jentic/api-ai-readiness-framework)
across six dimensions and returns a single grade — so you know exactly where to improve. Pair it
with the companion **api-improve** agent skill to apply those improvements automatically:
non-breaking edits, a reusable
[OpenAPI Overlay](https://spec.openapis.org/overlay/v1.1.0.html), and a before/after changelog.

## Quick start

1. Get a free key at the [Jentic Scorecard API Keys page](https://app.jentic.com/scorecard?tab=api-keys).

2. Score an OpenAPI document:

   ```bash
   JENTIC_API_KEY=<your-key> npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli score ./openapi.yaml
   ```

## What it scores

Each OpenAPI document is evaluated across six lenses — small, targeted improvements in any of them
tend to produce outsized gains for both human developers and AI agents:

- **Foundational Compliance (FC)** — structural validity and conformance to OpenAPI itself.
- **Developer Experience & Jentic Compatibility (DXJ)** — documentation quality and how well the
  OpenAPI document plays with downstream tooling.
- **AI-Readiness & Agent Experience (ARAX)** — semantic clarity and the context an LLM needs to
  reason about each operation.
- **Agent Usability (AU)** — predictable, safe multi-step orchestration.
- **Security (SEC)** — declared auth schemes and trust boundaries.
- **AI Discoverability (AID)** — how easily an AI system can find and parse the OpenAPI document.

## How it works

Scoring runs locally inside a Docker container in two phases. **Analysis** runs a battery of
validators and structural checks against the OpenAPI document to produce a set of diagnostics and
observations.
**Scoring** maps those into ~35 signals across the six JAIRF dimensions, aggregates them into
per-dimension scores, and rolls those up into a single weighted score and grade.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 20 LTS or newer (`>= 20.19.0`) with npm/npx. See [Node.js downloads](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Docker** installed and running. See [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
  The CLI pulls the scoring image automatically on first run.
- Network access to [`ghcr.io`](https://ghcr.io) (to pull the image) and to whatever URL hosts the
  OpenAPI document you're scoring (the engine fetches it from inside the container).

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @jentic/api-scorecard-cli
```

This installs the CLI globally. The scoring engine (Docker image) is downloaded automatically
the first time you run `score` — allow a minute or two on a typical connection.

For local files or non-OAK URLs you'll also need a `JENTIC_API_KEY` — see
[Anonymous vs keyed access](#anonymous-vs-keyed-access).

Verify the install:

```bash
jentic-api-scorecard --version
```

> **Prefer zero-install?** You can skip the global install and use `npx` — every example in
> this README works with `npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli` in place of `jentic-api-scorecard`.
> Pin to a specific release with `npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@<version>` (e.g. `@1.0.0`);
> the unpinned form resolves to whatever the `latest` dist-tag points at on each invocation,
> while `npm install -g` pins you to the installed version until you explicitly update.

## Try it now

OpenAPI documents from [Jentic Public APIs (OAK)](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-public-apis)
score without any key, uncapped — no signup, no config:

```bash
npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@latest score \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jentic/jentic-public-apis/refs/heads/main/apis/openapi/swagger-api/petstore/1.0.27/openapi.json
```

For URLs outside OAK or local files, set the API key:

```bash
JENTIC_API_KEY=<your-key> npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@latest score \
  https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
```

```bash
JENTIC_API_KEY=<your-key> npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@latest score ./openapi.yaml
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Free keys come with **100 scorings per month** (resets at the start of each calendar month). See [Anonymous vs keyed access](#anonymous-vs-keyed-access) for signup and quota details.

That's it. The CLI pulls the scoring engine automatically on first run.

![CLI score output](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-api-scorecard/raw/main/assets/cli-screenshot.png)

## Control output depth

The `--detail` flag lets you zoom in:

```bash
# Just the headline score and grade
npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@latest score --detail summary ./openapi.yaml

# Per-dimension breakdown (default)
npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@latest score --detail dimensions ./openapi.yaml

# Individual signals within each dimension
npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@latest score --detail signals ./openapi.yaml

# Full diagnostics with top 5 findings per severity
npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@latest score --detail diagnostics ./openapi.yaml
```

## Machine-readable output

Add `--format json` to emit engine-verbatim JSON on stdout (filtered by whatever
`--detail` level you pick). Pretty stays the unconditional default; `--format json`
is the canonical way to get a stable machine-readable channel for CI gating, archival,
or LLM-assisted review.

```bash
# Gate on the headline score in CI
npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@latest score ./openapi.yaml --format json | jq .summary.score

# Capture the full evidence bundle to a file
npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@latest score ./openapi.yaml \
  --format json --detail diagnostics --output report.json
```

`--output <file>` (`-o`) writes the report to a path instead of stdout; the spinner stays on stderr.

`--quiet` (`-q`) suppresses the stderr spinner even in interactive terminals (the spinner already
auto-suppresses when stderr isn't a TTY). Engine warnings still pass through stderr.

## HTML report

Add `--format html` to render an interactive, self-contained HTML scorecard — a single file
with all JS and CSS inlined (no external CDN, works offline), suitable for CI artifacts and
dashboards. It honours `--detail`, so `--detail diagnostics` embeds the full evidence bundle.

![HTML scorecard report](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-api-scorecard/raw/main/assets/cli-html-report.png)

Because the output is a full HTML document, the CLI refuses to print it straight into an
interactive terminal — redirect it or use `-o`:

```bash
# Redirect to a file
npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@latest score ./openapi.yaml --format html > scorecard.html

# Or write it with -o, at full detail
npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@latest score ./openapi.yaml \
  --format html --detail diagnostics -o scorecard.html
```

## LLM analysis

Add `--with-llm` to unlock LLM-backed signals — deeper semantic reasoning about whether your API
descriptions are actionable for agents, whether error responses support autonomous recovery, and
more. Requires an LLM provider: cloud (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / AWS Bedrock) or a local
OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, …).

Without `--with-llm`, the LLM-backed signals are not evaluated — they hold an assumed-perfect
baseline score until `--with-llm` actually assesses them. A default (no-`--with-llm`) scorecard
therefore reflects only the deterministic signals, with the LLM-backed ones sitting at that perfect
baseline; turn on `--with-llm` to have them genuinely assessed (which can lower your score).

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export LLM_PROVIDER=OPENAI
export LIGHT_LLM_PROVIDER=OPENAI
export LLM_LIGHT_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

JENTIC_API_KEY=<your-key> npx @jentic/api-scorecard-cli@latest score ./openapi.yaml --with-llm
```

Token cost is low — the engine uses a lightweight model (e.g. Claude Haiku, GPT-4o-mini),
processes operations in small batches, and caps at 7 batches regardless of spec size. Local
models (Ollama) cost nothing per call.

If the LLM calls fail (bad credentials, an inaccessible model, an unreachable endpoint), the
affected LLM-backed signals get scored as perfect — which would inflate their dimension(s) and the
overall score. Rather than print a misleading scorecard, the CLI **suppresses the report, names the
affected signals and the provider error on stderr, and exits `8`** — so a CI job running
`--with-llm` fails loudly instead of passing on an inflated score. Fix the provider error and
retry, or re-run without `--with-llm` for a valid score from the non-LLM signals.

See **[LLM Signals guide](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-api-scorecard/blob/main/docs/llm-signals.md)**
for all provider recipes (including local Ollama), the full environment variable reference, and
troubleshooting.

## Anonymous vs keyed access

OpenAPI documents from [Jentic Public APIs (OAK)](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-public-apis)
score without any key and stay on the free tier — those URLs bypass key validation entirely.
For everything else (local files, URLs outside OAK), get a key from the [Jentic Scorecard API Keys page](https://app.jentic.com/scorecard?tab=api-keys). Then set it:

```bash
export JENTIC_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

Real keys are validated live by the container against `api.jentic.com`. The same call doubles
as the per-key usage / rate-limit accounting hit. **Each free key gets 100 scorings per month**,
resetting at the start of each calendar month. Once that quota is exhausted the CLI exits with
code `7` and prints the `Retry-After` value along with a link to upgrade your plan.

## Skills

This repository ships two complementary agent skills — install either or both through
whichever path fits your agent.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `jentic-api-scorecard` | Teaches coding agents to use the scoring CLI: scoring files and URLs, producing JSON/HTML, wiring into CI, and interpreting exit codes. |
| `jentic-api-improve` | Closes the loop: applies improvements to a spec automatically (non-breaking by default; `summary-description` and `full` modes available), with an `oasdiff` breaking-change check, producing an improved spec, an OpenAPI Overlay, and a before/after changelog. |

### jentic-api-scorecard

A versioned [agent skill](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-api-scorecard/blob/main/skills/jentic-api-scorecard/SKILL.md)
that teaches AI coding agents how to use the CLI correctly — installing it, scoring
files and URLs, producing JSON/HTML, wiring it into CI, enabling LLM analysis, and
interpreting exit codes.

#### Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) users install it
as a [plugin](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins) — this repository
doubles as a plugin marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add jentic/jentic-api-scorecard
/plugin install api-scorecard@jentic-api-scorecard
```

The `install` argument is `<plugin>@<marketplace>`: the marketplace is always
`jentic-api-scorecard`, and the part before the `@` is the plugin name — `api-scorecard`
here, or `api-improve` for the [improve skill](#jentic-api-improve).

Once installed, the skill loads automatically when you ask Claude to score an OpenAPI document —
no explicit invocation needed:

```
> Score ./openapi.yaml for AI-readiness
> How AI-ready is https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json?
```

To force it into context regardless of phrasing, invoke it explicitly with
`/api-scorecard:jentic-api-scorecard`.

#### Vercel `skills` CLI

Install it straight from this repository with the
[`skills` CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

```bash
npx skills add jentic/jentic-api-scorecard --skill jentic-api-scorecard
```

It's also listed in the [skills.sh directory](https://skills.sh/jentic/jentic-api-scorecard).

#### TanStack Intent

The `@jentic/api-scorecard-cli` npm package also ships this skill inside its published
tarball, so it's discoverable by [TanStack Intent](https://tanstack.com/intent) for
projects that already depend on the CLI and want version-aligned agent guidance.

### jentic-api-improve

Scoring tells you _what_ to fix; the `jentic-api-improve` skill closes the loop and
_fixes_ it. Point an AI coding agent at an OpenAPI document and it runs a baseline
score, identifies the weak dimensions and the semantic diagnostics, applies
improvements (by default **non-breaking** — adding `summary`/`description`/`example`/`tags`,
never changing existing paths, parameters, or response shapes), and produces three
artifacts: an improved spec, an [OpenAPI Overlay](https://spec.openapis.org/overlay/v1.1.0.html)
(the reusable delta), and a changelog with before/after scores.

A `mode` argument bounds how far the skill may go:

- **`summary-description`** — applies only the LLM-sourced `summary`/`description`
  suggestions from the scorecard's diagnostics (requires `--with-llm`; fails if no LLM
  is available).
- **`non-breaking`** (default) — the full strictly-additive set above.
- **`full`** — more iterations and a broader set of edits, **including breaking
  changes**, bounded by a guard that never lets any JAIRF dimension drop below baseline.

Every run also runs an [`oasdiff`](https://github.com/oasdiff/oasdiff) breaking-change
check against the original spec: the result is reported in the changelog in all modes,
and a detected break **fails the run** in `summary-description` / `non-breaking` (it is
reported but non-fatal in `full`).

This skill orchestrates the scorecard CLI plus a few extra command-line tools, so it
needs more than the CLI alone. In addition to the scorecard CLI's
[Requirements](#requirements) (Node.js ≥ 20.19, a running Docker daemon, and a
`JENTIC_API_KEY` for local-file scoring), install:

```bash
pipx install jentic-openapi-tools     # validation
pipx install jentic-apitools-cli      # overlay verification (command: jentic-apitools)
pipx install check-jsonschema         # overlay schema validation
go install github.com/oasdiff/oasdiff@latest   # breaking-change detection (or: brew install oasdiff)
# plus python3 and jq, which most systems already have
```

Install the skill through whichever path fits your agent — the same three channels as
the [scoring skill](#jentic-api-scorecard):

#### Claude Code

The improve skill is a **separate plugin** in this repository's marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add jentic/jentic-api-scorecard
/plugin install api-improve@jentic-api-scorecard
```

The marketplace half is the same `jentic-api-scorecard` as the [scoring
skill](#jentic-api-scorecard) — only the plugin name changes, to `api-improve`.

Installing the plugin also registers the companion `jentic-api-improve` subagent (used
for multi-iteration improvement loops). Once installed, ask Claude to improve a spec:

```
> Improve ./openapi.yaml for AI-readiness
> Raise the JAIRF score of my API and give me an overlay
```

#### Vercel `skills` CLI

```bash
npx skills add jentic/jentic-api-scorecard --skill jentic-api-improve
```

#### TanStack Intent

The `@jentic/api-scorecard-cli` npm package ships this skill (and the companion agent
definition) inside its published tarball, so it's discoverable by
[TanStack Intent](https://tanstack.com/intent) for projects that already depend on the
CLI. The agent file lands at `agents/jentic-api-improve.md`; copy it into your
`.claude/agents/` to enable the declarative subagent (optional — the skill falls back to
spawning a subagent from an inline brief).

## CLI reference

```
jentic-api-scorecard [-V | --version] [-h | --help]
jentic-api-scorecard <command> [options]
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| [`score <input>`](#score) | Score an OpenAPI document by URL or local file path. |
| [`convert <input>`](#convert) | Reformat a saved scorecard JSON file without re-scoring. |

### `score`

Score an OpenAPI document by URL or local file path.

```
jentic-api-scorecard score <input> [options]
```

#### Arguments

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `<input>` | `http(s)://` URL or local file path to an OpenAPI document. Required. |

#### Options

| Flag | Default | Choices | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--with-llm` | off | — | Enable LLM-backed analysis. Requires an LLM provider (see [LLM analysis](#llm-analysis)). |
| `--bundle` | off | — | Force CLI-side bundling for URL inputs: the CLI fetches the URL on the host, bundles with Redocly, and pipes to the container via stdin. Use for URLs only the host can reach (internal networks, VPN-gated specs, auth-required URLs). Requires `JENTIC_API_KEY`. No-op for local files. |
| `-d, --detail <level>` | `dimensions` | `summary`, `dimensions`, `signals`, `diagnostics` | Payload depth (see [Control output depth](#control-output-depth)). |
| `-f, --format <fmt>` | `pretty` | `pretty`, `json`, `html`, `markdown`, `sarif` | Output encoding (`markdown` is a GitHub-flavored projection for `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` / PR comments; `sarif` projects diagnostics only as SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub code-scanning and always emits full diagnostics regardless of `--detail`; see also [Machine-readable output](#machine-readable-output) and [HTML report](#html-report)). |
| `-o, --output <file>` | stdout | — | Write the formatted report to `<file>`. The spinner stays on stderr. |
| `-q, --quiet` | off | — | Suppress the stderr spinner regardless of TTY. |
| `-h, --help` | — | — | Show usage for `score`. |

#### Environment

| Variable | When | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `JENTIC_API_KEY` | URLs outside OAK and local files | Real key issued at the [Jentic Scorecard API Keys page](https://app.jentic.com/scorecard?tab=api-keys); validated live against `api.jentic.com` (see [Anonymous vs keyed access](#anonymous-vs-keyed-access)). **Free quota: 100 scorings per calendar month.** |
| LLM provider + routing vars | With `--with-llm` | The CLI auto-detects credentials (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, AWS keys) and routing (`LLM_PROVIDER`, `LIGHT_LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_LIGHT_MODEL`, `*_API_URL`, `LLM_MAX_TOKENS`) and forwards them to the container; loopback URLs are rewritten so a host-side Ollama is reachable. Full reference: [LLM Signals guide](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-api-scorecard/blob/main/docs/llm-signals.md). |

#### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Scoring completed (regardless of the score itself). |
| 1 | Generic error (bad input, unexpected container failure, output write failure). |
| 2 | Auth: `JENTIC_API_KEY` is set to a value the Jentic backend does not recognize, or a local file / stdin input was used without the key set. |
| 3 | Anonymous gate rejected: URL outside the OAK allowlist and no key set. |
| 4 | Docker not installed or daemon unreachable. |
| 5 | Spec fetch, parse, or host-side bundling failure (local files and `--bundle` URLs). |
| 6 | Engine invocation failure. |
| 7 | Rate limit reached: the key is valid but the user is over quota. Message includes the server-provided `detail` and the `Retry-After` header when present. |
| 8 | LLM analysis failed under `--with-llm`: the provider call failed, so the LLM-derived signals would be scored as perfect and inflate the result. The CLI suppresses the report and prints the affected signals + provider error on stderr. Re-run without `--with-llm` for a valid non-LLM score. |

### `convert`

Reformat a saved scorecard JSON file without re-scoring. Useful for producing multiple output formats from a single `score` run — no Docker or API key required (a URL `<input>` is still fetched over HTTP).

```
jentic-api-scorecard convert <input> [options]
```

**Recommended CI recipe** (score once, format many):

```sh
# Step 1 — score once and save full output
jentic-api-scorecard score ./openapi.yaml --format json --detail diagnostics -o report.json

# Step 2 — derive HTML and SARIF without a second Docker run
jentic-api-scorecard convert report.json --format html -o scorecard.html
jentic-api-scorecard convert report.json --format sarif -o results.sarif
```

> **Note:** For lossless reformatting, save at `--detail diagnostics`. A scorecard saved at a shallower detail level cannot have the missing fields recovered at `convert` time.

#### `convert` arguments

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `<input>` | `http(s)://` URL or local file path to a scorecard JSON file (produced by `score --format json`). Required. |

#### `convert` options

| Flag | Default | Choices | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-d, --detail <level>` | `dimensions` | `summary`, `dimensions`, `signals`, `diagnostics` | Payload depth applied on top of the saved level. |
| `-f, --format <fmt>` | `pretty` | `pretty`, `json`, `html`, `markdown`, `sarif` | Output encoding. Same semantics as `score --format`, including the SARIF exception below. |
| `-o, --output <file>` | stdout | — | Write the formatted report to `<file>`. |
| `-h, --help` | — | — | Show usage for `convert`. |

`--format sarif` always emits the full diagnostics regardless of `--detail` (same as `score`); an explicit non-`diagnostics` `--detail` combined with `--format sarif` prints a warning on stderr rather than silently being ignored.

#### `convert` exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Conversion completed. |
| 1 | Generic error (input neither a URL nor an existing file, fetch/read failure, not valid JSON, not a scorecard, output write failure). |

## GitHub Action

A composite GitHub Action wraps the CLI for CI: it scores an OpenAPI document, **gates the build**
on the score, uploads SARIF findings to the **Security tab**, attaches the **HTML scorecard** as a
downloadable artifact, and renders a **Markdown summary** on the run page.

```yaml
name: API readiness
on: [pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write # required so SARIF uploads to the Security tab

jobs:
  scorecard:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: jentic/jentic-api-scorecard@v1 # floating major tag (or pin a full version / commit SHA)
        with:
          input: ./openapi.yaml
          api-key: ${{ secrets.JENTIC_API_KEY }}
          min-score: '70'
```

To enable LLM-backed analysis, set `with-llm: true` and provide the provider credentials and
routing as job-level `env:` — the action forwards them to the engine but does not turn raw secrets
into those variables for you, so the run fails fast if none are present:

```yaml
jobs:
  scorecard:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
      LLM_PROVIDER: OPENAI
      LIGHT_LLM_PROVIDER: OPENAI
      LLM_LIGHT_MODEL: gpt-4o-mini
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: jentic/jentic-api-scorecard@v1
        with:
          input: ./openapi.yaml
          api-key: ${{ secrets.JENTIC_API_KEY }}
          with-llm: 'true'
```

See the **[LLM Signals guide](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-api-scorecard/blob/main/docs/llm-signals.md)**
for the full provider matrix (cloud and local Ollama) and the variable reference.

### Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `input` | — | **Required.** `http(s)://` URL or local file path to an OpenAPI document. |
| `api-key` | — | Jentic API key. Required for local files and non-OAK URLs; never logged. |
| `github-token` | workflow token | Token for the SARIF upload (see fork PRs below). |
| `min-score` | — | Fail when the score is below this. Unset = no gate. |
| `max-errors` | — | Fail when error-level findings exceed this. Unset = no gate. |
| `max-warnings` | — | Fail when warning-level findings exceed this. Unset = no gate. |
| `severity` | `warning` | Minimum level kept in the SARIF. |
| `max-findings` | `5000` | Cap on SARIF results, lowest-severity dropped first. |
| `with-llm` | `false` | Enable LLM-backed analysis. |
| `summary-detail` | `dimensions` | Markdown run-summary depth: `summary`, `dimensions`, `signals`, `diagnostics`. |
| `cli-version` | action's release | CLI version to run (pins the engine image); defaults to the version shipped with the action ref you pinned. |

**Choosing your gates.** Set `min-score` to fail PRs below a readiness bar, and/or `max-errors` /
`max-warnings` to fail on too many findings. Each finding carries one of three levels — `error`,
`warning`, `note` — which is how it's labelled on its Security-tab alert. (If you also read
`--format json`, those map from its 1–4 severity: `1` is error, `2` is warning, `3` and `4` are both
note.) The `severity` input only trims which findings reach the Security tab; it never changes your
gate, so quieting the Security tab to errors-only won't let a warning-heavy spec slip through.

**Outputs land even on a failing build.** When a gate fails, you still get the SARIF findings, the
HTML artifact, and the Markdown summary — a failing PR is exactly when you want to see them.

**Choose your pin deliberately.** The `@v1` major tag (used in the examples above) floats to the
newest `v1.x.x` on every release, so you auto-receive fixes without a workflow edit and stay within
one major — no breaking changes. The trade-off: a release can ship a new scoring engine, and the
same document can score differently across engine versions, so a green PR can turn red when `@v1`
moves under it. If you gate on a hard threshold and need that build reproducible, pin a full version
(`@v1.8.3`) or a commit SHA instead, and bump it deliberately when you're ready to adopt a new
engine.

**On fork PRs**, GitHub gives the workflow a read-only token, so the Security-tab upload can't run;
the action skips it with a notice and still publishes the HTML artifact and Markdown summary.
(Uploading fork findings anyway needs a writable token from a base-context workflow, supplied via
`github-token`.) In the Security tab, findings link to the document but not yet to a specific line.

## Prefer a browser?

[**jentic.com/scorecard**](https://jentic.com/scorecard) offers the same scoring in a web UI —
paste a URL or drop a file, no Docker or Node required.

## Enterprise-ready by default

For teams that need to know exactly what's running, verify exactly what was
shipped, and run without a runtime dependency on Jentic.

### Your OpenAPI document never leaves your environment

Scoring runs entirely in a container **on your own machine**. Local files are
piped in over stdin; URLs are fetched on your side — by the container's engine,
or host-side by the CLI when you pass `--bundle` — never by Jentic. Either way,
your spec is never uploaded.

The **only** call to Jentic is a key-check round-trip against `api.jentic.com` —
it carries your key, never any part of your spec, and OAK URLs (jentic-public-apis)
skip even that. The one exception is `--with-llm`, which sends spec context to the
LLM provider **you** choose (point it at a local Ollama to keep that on-machine too).

### Auditable end to end

Every component in the scoring stack — runner, CLI, release pipeline, and
engine — is Apache 2.0 licensed and source-readable. No proprietary blobs,
no closed-source shims. Read the code that's about to grade your specs
before you adopt it; audit any line, redistribute under the license terms,
fork if you ever need to.

### Signed for regulated environments

Every npm tarball and every GHCR image is signed by [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)
with SLSA provenance and an SPDX SBOM. Signing happens inside an OIDC-driven
GitHub Actions workflow with no long-lived publishing secrets — there is no
`NPM_TOKEN`, no PAT, and no human keyholder in the release chain. One command
verifies an artifact end-to-end before you install it:

- **[npm package supply chain →](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-api-scorecard/blob/main/docs/supply-chain-npm.md)** —
  npm provenance, SPDX SBOM, trusted publishing, and the `gh attestation verify` recipes.
- **[Docker image supply chain →](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-api-scorecard/blob/main/docs/supply-chain-docker.md)** —
  per-platform SBOMs, dual-store attestations (BuildKit OCI referrers + Sigstore), and
  verification via either `docker buildx imagetools inspect` or `gh attestation verify`.

### Runs anywhere

The image is a closed system at scoring time: every Python wheel, Node.js
binary, and validator tarball it needs is baked in at build time, so scoring
pulls no runtime packages from PyPI or npmjs. Multi-arch images (linux/amd64 +
linux/arm64) ship from the same release, so the same guarantees hold on Apple
Silicon dev machines, ARM CI runners, and x86 servers alike.

### Pinned for reproducibility

CLI version, image tag, and engine version are locked one-to-one. Pinning
`@jentic/api-scorecard-cli@<version>` resolves to a specific image tag, which
in turn pins an exact engine release and exact validator versions. Last
month's score is reproducible from last month's pin.

## Status

The CLI ships **stable** under the `latest` npm dist-tag — release cadence is driven by
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Track in-flight work in
[`specs/roadmap.md`](https://github.com/jentic/jentic-api-scorecard/blob/main/specs/roadmap.md).

The `:unstable` Docker image is rebuilt on every push to `main` for direct `docker run` users.
Versioned images are published alongside each CLI release.
